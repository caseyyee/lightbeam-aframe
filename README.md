# Lightbeam-AFrame

This is the WebVR version of the [Lightbeam](https://github.com/mozilla/lightbeam-we) web-extension using [A-Frame](https://aframe.io).

This repo is adapted from the [A-Frame boilerplate](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-boilerplate) for creating VR scenes with A-Frame.
Alternatively, check out the [A-Frame Starter on
glitch.com](https://glitch.com/~aframe) for a more interactive way on getting
started.

## Getting Started

- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- Then launch the site from your favorite WebVR enabled browser:
`[__http://localhost:3000/__](http://localhost:3000/)`

## Notes

- This is a work in progress
- Initial demo can be found [here](http://faithful-hope.glitch.me/)
